> A school in Connecticut once held "a day devoted to the arts," and I was asked if I would come and talk about writing as a vocation. When I arrived I found that a second speaker had been invited-Dr. Brock(as I'll call him), a surgeon who had recently begun to write and had sold some stories to magazines. He was going to talk about writing as an avocation. That made us a pannel, and we sat down to face a crowd of students and teachers and parents, all eager to learn the secrets of our glamorous work.

康涅狄格州的一所学校曾经举办了“将一天奉献给艺术”的活动，我被邀请来做关于写作作为一种职业的演讲。当我到达时，我发现第二位被受邀的演讲人是布洛克博士（我将这样称呼他），他是一名外科医生，最近开始写作且出售了一些故事给杂志。他将要谈论写作作为一种业务爱好。这样让我们组成了一个小组，我们坐下来面对着一大群渴望能学习了解我们独特工作秘密的学生，教师和父母。

> Dr. Brock was dressed in a bright red jacket, looking vaguely bohemian, as authors are supposed to look, and the first question went to him. What was it like to be a writer?

布洛克博士身穿明亮的红色夹克，看起来略带波西米亚风格，就像人们认为作家就应该是这个样子，他被问到的第一个问题是：当作家感觉如何？

> He said it was tremendous fun. Coming home from an arduous day at the hosptial, he would go straight to his yellow pad and write his tensions away. The words just flowed. It was easy. I then said that writing wasn't easy, and wasn't fun. It was hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flowed.

他说这非常有趣。在医院度过辛苦的一天回到家后，他会径直走向他的黄色便笺簿，通过写作来消除紧张情绪。文思泉涌。这很简单。然后我说写作并不简单也不有趣。写作是艰难且孤独的，而且很少能文思泉涌。

> Next Dr. Brock was asked if it was important to rewrite. Absolutely not, he said. "Let it all hang out," he told us, and whatever form the sentences take will reflect the writer at his most natural. I then said that rewriting is the essence of writing. I pointed out that professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over and then rewrite what they have rewriten.

- the essence of “......的本质；......的精髓”
  - “The essence of the problem lies in the lack of communication. ”（问题的本质在于缺乏沟通。）

接下来，布洛克博士被问到重写是否重要。绝对不是，“顺其自然”，他告诉我们，无论句子采取何种形式都将反映出作者最自然的状态。我随后说道，重写是写作的精髓。我指出职业作家重写他们的句子一遍又一遍，然后重写他们已经重写过的内容。

> "What do you do on days when it isn't going well?" Dr. Brock was asked. He said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go better. I then said that the professional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling himself. He is also going broke.

“你在写作不顺利的时候是怎么做的呢？”，布洛克博士被问到。他说只是停止写作然后将工作搁置到一边直到事情有所改善。然后我说，一个职业的作家必须建立日常写作计划并坚持到底。我说写作是一件手艺，而不是一门艺术，一个人如果因为缺乏灵感而躲避他的手艺是自欺欺人。他也会走向破产。
 
>"What if you're feeling depressed or unhappy?" a student asked. "Won't that affect your writing?"

当你感到绝望或不高兴的时候会怎么样？一个学生问到，这样是否会影响到你的写作？

> Probably it will, Dr. Brock replied. Go fishing. Take a walk. Probably it won't, I said. If your job is to write every day, you learn to do it like any other job.

可能会。布洛克博士回答到。钓鱼、散步。我说大概率是不会的，如果你的工作是每天都写作，那么你就需要像做其他工作一样，学会在这种环境中写作。

> A student asked if we found it useful to circulate in the literary world. Dr. Brock said he was greatly enjoying his new life as a man of letters, and he told several stories of being taken to lunch by his publisher and his agent at Manhattan restaurants where writers and editors gather. I said that professional writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers.

一个学生问我们发现在文学世界中流转是否是有用的。布洛克博士说他很享受作为文人的新生活，他讲诉了几个他被出版商和经纪人带去曼哈顿作家和编辑常去的餐厅吃午餐的故事。我说职业的作家都是孤独的苦工，很少见到其他作家。

> "Do you put symbolism in your writing?" a student asked me.

“你的作品有象征意义吗？”一个学生问到。

> "Not if I can help it," I replied. I have an unbroken record of missing the deeper meaning in any story, play or movie, and as for dance and mine, I have never had any idea of what is being conveyed.

“如果可能的话，我不会那样做，”我回答说，我在任何故事，戏剧或电影中从未理解过深层含义，至于舞蹈和哑剧，我从未明白他们想表达的是什么。

> "I love symbols!" Dr. Brock exclaimed, and he described with gusto the joys of weaving them through his work.

“我喜欢象征！”布洛克博士惊呼道，他兴致勃勃地描绘了将他们融入到工作中的乐趣。

> So the morning went, and it was a revelation to all of us. At the end Dr. Brock told me he was enormously interested in my answers--it had never occurred to him that writing could be hard. I told him I was just as interested in his answers--it had never occurred to me that writing could be easy. Maybe I should take up surgery on the side.

所以，整个早晨就这样过去了，这对我们所有人来说都是一个启示。最后布洛克博士告诉我他对我的答案很感兴趣--他从未想过写作可能会很难。我告诉他我对他的回答同样很感兴趣--我从未想过写作可以这么简单。或许我应该在业余时间尝试学习做手术。

> As for the students, anyone might think we left them bewildered. But in fact we gave them a broader glimpse of the writing process than if only one of us had talked. For there isn't any "right" way to do such personal work. There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by word processor, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can't write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.

至于学生们，任何人可能都会认为我们让他们感到困惑。但事实上，我们让他们对写作过程有了更广泛的了解，这比只有我们其中一人发言的效果要好。因为对于这种个人化的工作并没有“正确”的方式。有各种各样的作家和方法，任何能帮助你说你想说的方法对你来说都是好的方法。有些人白天写作，有些人晚上写作。有些人需要安静，有些人则打开收音机。有些人手写，有些人用文字处理器，有些人对着录音机口述。有些人一口气写完初稿然后修改；有些人不反复修改第一段就写不出第二段。

> But all of them are vulnerable and all of them are tense. They are driven by a compulsion to put some part of themselves on paper, and yet they don't just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the person who sat down to write. The problem is to find the real man or woman behind the tension.

但是他们都是脆弱且紧张的。他们迫不及待把自己的某些部分写在纸上，但他们并不是写下自然而然的东西。他们坐下来进行文学行为，而出现在纸上的自我比坐下来的写作的人要僵硬的多。问题是找到隐藏在紧张背后的真实男人或女人。

> Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It's not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.

最后作家需要售卖的商品并不是作品本身，而是他或她自己。我经常发现自己读我从未想过会让我感到有趣的有趣的话题--或许是一些科学探索。吸引我的是作家对其领域的热情。他是如何被吸引进去的？他带来了什么样的情感包袱？怎么样改变了他的生活？没有必要孤独地在瓦尔登湖生活了一年之后才能与这样一位作家交往。

> This is the personal transaction that's at the heart of good nonfiction writing. Out of it come two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: humanity and warmth. Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next, and it's not a question of gimmicks to "personalize" the author. It's a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

- “gimmick”：名词，意为“噱头；花招；诡计”。
  - “The new product was just a marketing gimmick. ”（这个新产品只是个营销噱头。）

这是优秀的非小说写作的核心所在的个人交流。由此产生了本书将要寻找的两个重要的品质：人性和温情。好的写作有一种活力可以让读者从一段读到下一段，这不是个性化作者噱头的问题。问题在于如何以最清晰最有力的方式使用英语。

> Can such principles be taught? Maybe not. But most of them can be learned.
这样的原则能被教授吗？也许不能。但其中大多数是可以学习的。
